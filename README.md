# Ceedling + TM4C123GH6PM Test

This project is a test in configuring the Ceedling test harness for C with the TM4C123GH6PM (Tiva Launchpad) microcontroller.
Developed using TDD to make a simple program that turns the red LED on whenever the built-in SW1 is closed. 

# Learning Objectives

* Gain experience with configuring Ceedling with the Tiva Launchpad so I can use Ceedling in future projects.
* Make a project from scratch that uses fakes and mocks to isolate hardware interactions from application logic.
* Learn how to design the tests such that they will drive code that works in both the test environment and on the target.
* Practice what I learned from reading James W. Grenning's "Test Driven Development for Embedded C".
